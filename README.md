Case Study to analyse Magist' options for entering Brazilian market
In this project we worked on the following case study"

##  company context:
We are in the summer of 2018. Yes, COVID-19 still does not exist, Donald Trump is the President of the United States, and the world has yet to be amazed by the wonderful capabilities of AI-powered chat agents.

Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. It was founded ten years ago in Spain and has since grown and expanded to other neighboring countries.



In addition to offering a wide catalog of products at competitive prices, Eniac provides friendly and professional tech support and consultation to its customers. The warmhearted spirit that thrives with direct contact with the customers is at the core of the company.

Since the company went public, investors have been pushing for Eniac to scale up the business and become a major e-commerce player globally. It goes without saying that it is an arduous challenge to do so while retaining the human side of the business, which is Eniac’s emblem.

Here are some numbers that will help you understand Eniac’s scope (data from April 2017 to March 2018):



As part of Eniac’s scaling efforts, a Data department was established. Currently, it consists of three members:

The Head of Data: responsible for designing, setting up, and maintaining the company’s data architecture. They oversee data pipelines and ensure the reliability of the data.
The Data Scientist: hired to develop and deploy a recommender system to enhance cross-selling opportunities.
The Data Analyst: and that’s you! The Data department needed someone who is more than just an engineer or a nerd. They sought someone who can find meaning in data and effectively communicate insights and recommendations to other departments.


The organigram illustrates that your direct reporting line is to the Head of Data, yet it’s crucial to maintain robust interconnections with other departments, including Marketing. Furthermore, it’s essential to incorporate the overall business strategy as an integral part of your everyday tasks, ensuring your work always aligns with the corporate vision.

## Case

Eniac is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market. Data shows that Brazil has an eCommerce revenue similar to that of Spain and Italy: an already huge market with an even bigger potential for growth. The problem for Eniac is the lack of knowledge of such a market. The company doesn’t have ties with local providers, package delivery services, or customer service agencies. Creating these ties and knowing the market would take a lot of time, while the board of directors has demanded the expansion to happen within the next year.

Here comes Magist. Magist is a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces. In addition, Magist provides after-sales services such as stock and warehouse management, product shipment, and customer service related to the shipment.

Magist is already a big player and allows small companies to benefit from its economies of scale: it has signed advantageous contracts with the marketplaces and with the Post Office, thus reducing the cost of fees and, most importantly, the bureaucracy involved in getting things started.

Eniac sells through its own e-commerce store in Europe, with its own site and direct providers for all the steps of the supply chain. In Brazil, however, Eniac is considering signing a 3-year contract with Magist as an intermediate step, while it tests the market, creates brand awareness, and explores the option of setting up its own supply chain management.

Note that Magist differs from e-commerce platforms like Amazon or eBay. Eniac will continue selling its products in Brazil through its own website and brand.

The economic conditions of the deal are already being discussed. But not everyone in the company is happy moving on with this. There are two main concerns:

Eniac’s catalogue is 100% tech products and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories. It is not clear that Magist is a good partner for these high-end tech products.
Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. The delivery fees resulting from Magist’s deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? Are deliveries fast enough?
Thankfully, Magist has allowed Eniac to access a snapshot of their database. The data might have the answer to these concerns. Here’s where you come in: you will be the one exploring Magist’s database. On day 5 of your first week, you will meet the board of directors and expose your recommendations.
